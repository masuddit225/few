I respect him as a player and love him as a person. He&#8217;s a really nice guy.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Djokovic&#8217;s win kept him on course for a championship match showdown with world number one and US Open champion Carlos Alcaraz who defeated 84th-ranked Alexandre Muller of France 6-4, 7-6 (7\/2), 6-3.<\/p>\n<p>The 20-year-old Alcaraz will face Chile&#8217;s Nicolas Jarry for a spot in the last 16.<\/p>\n<p>Murray admitted he doesn&#8217;t know if he will be back at\u00a0Wimbledon\u00a0after going down 7-6 (7\/3), 6-7 (2\/7), 4-6, 7-6 (7\/3), 6-4 to fifth-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas in a four-hour 40-minute second round epic.<\/p>\n<p>The 36-year-old has not made the second week of a Grand Slam since reaching the quarter-finals at\u00a0Wimbledon\u00a0in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said former world number one Murray when asked if he would be back in 2024.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Motivation is obviously a big thing. Continuing having early losses in tournaments like this don&#8217;t necessarily help with that.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Tsitispas fired 90 winners past Murray and goes on to face Laslo Djere of Serbia for a place in the last 16.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never easy against Andy.
